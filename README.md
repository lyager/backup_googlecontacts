_Warning_ Currently GData seems to have an issue after Google did an API
change. A workaround is described [here](https://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/issues/detail?can=2&start=0&num=100&q=&colspec=Opened%20Stars%20ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Component%20Summary&groupby=&sort=&id=69).
Currently it hasn't been changed in GData's Mercurial repo.
